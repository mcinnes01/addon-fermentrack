Installing docker image
-----------------------

Requirements for installation
=============================

Pre-requsities, install the following docker components according to installation instructions for your platform:

* Docker (or DockerDesktop)
* Docker compose

The following target platforms are tested so far; 

* linux/armv7   (Tested on Raspberry PI)
* linux/amd64   (Tested on Ubuntu)
* linux/i386    ()

Installation via docker-compose
===============================

To install and start the docker image via docker-compose you need to create a .yaml file that contains the right configuration for your system; 

It's important to update the volume part (full or relative) for the 3 volumes that will be mapped into the container;

* /home/fermentrack/fermentrack/db      (contains the database file)
* /home/fermentrack/fermentrack/data    (contains beer logs)
* /home/fermentrack/fermentrack/log     (contains logfiles from system)

For some functions to work it's needed to run the container in priviliged mode and network_mode=host. This also means that the port mapping 
will be ignored and fermentrack will be accessed on port 8080 which is the default port used in the image.  This applies to the following functions:

* Update firmware on brewpi controllers via USB
* Connect a tilt via Bluetooth
* Use MDNS functionallity

::

    version: '3'
    services:
    fermentrack:
        image: mpse2/fermentrack-docker
        container_name: fermentrack
        restart: always
        network_mode: "host"
        privileged: true
        volumes:
            - ./db:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/db
            - ./data:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/data
            - ./log:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/log
            - /dev:/dev


If you dont need the functionallity described above use the following configuration.

::

    version: '3'
    services:
    fermentrack:
        image: mpse2/fermentrack-docker
        container_name: fermentrack
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "80:8080"
        volumes:
            - ./db:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/db
            - ./data:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/data
            - ./log:/home/fermentrack/fermentrack/log


The following commands will download the image and then start the container. The yaml file needs to be in the current directory.

Download image:

``docker-compose pull``

Start container:

``docker-compose up``

Stop container:

``docker-compose down``

If everything is working as planned you should see a similar startup screen like this. The last line (Starting circus deamon) indicate that everything has started as it should.

Things to consider when running in privliged mode
=================================================

Some functions require the container to be run in privliged mode mainly to access resouces of the host system. This include Bluetooth and USB devices.

If the system is run in priviliged mode using the host network the following network ports needs to be available for the container to start;

* 8080 webserver 
* 8123 django server
* 6379 redis server
